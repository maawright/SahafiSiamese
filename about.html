      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Alison.</p>
      <p>
        I live in Warrington, Cheshire and I breed & show siamese cats. I have
        always had at least 1 Siamese cat in my life. All my cats live at home
        with us and are part of our family myself my husband Mike and our 4
        children Finn, Harry, Sam and Amelia.
      </p>
      <h2>My Girls</h2>
      <p>
        My girls live in the house and we have a catio for them to go out in and
        enjoy the garden. By living together and with us they are socialised
        from young to be used to living in a home environment and interacting
        with people.
      </p>
      <h2>My Boys</h2>
      <p>
        My boys have outdoor heated chalets to live in and are harness trained
        to exercise in the garden. Due to the nature of stud boys they are kept
        apart but they are so lovbing with us when we see them, and they love to
        play with the children.
      </p>
      <h2>My Kittens</h2>
      <p>
        I have a nursery where all kittens are born and raised until they are
        old enough to socialise with the other cats
      </p>
